## Saddles have a damage reduction coefficient of 4 with regard to firearms and melee weapons.

## Damage Modifier = 100 / [ 100 + (4 * SADDLE ARMOR)]

## So in your scenario of 55 armor, the damage mod would be approx 31.25%--i.e. only takes 31.25 actual damage for every 100 raw damage hit.

## Auto Turrets do 77 raw damage--but turrets do 2.2x damage to dinos--so each bullet from an auto turret does ~169.4 raw damage.

## After applying the saddle damage mod (~31.25%) to the raw damage (~169.4), the resulting damage per bullet is ~52.94.

## Figuring out how many bullets it would take to drop a 50k health bronto that only takes ~52.94 damage per bullet is likely a bit more involved than a simple bit of division--which would suggest 945 bullets--which would be the absolute minimum.

## You'd need to take into account the bronto's passive health regen in addition to any regen from Sweet Veggie Cakes. Then pit that against the maximum modified DPS per auto turret (2.86 RPS \* 52.94); 151.4 DPS per auto turret.

## Disregarding their natural passive health regen, herbivores can sustain 42 health per second regeneration via veggie cakes (this averages the 20 seconds of regen plus the 30 second cooldown.)

## Anyway. Hope that helps somewhat. (Also it'd take a single turret something like 5 minutes 31 seconds to kill this hypothetical bronto if it was standing still without a rider or veggie cakes--or 33 turrets about 10 seconds)

## But that's not very many bullets, so let's say your bronto is mate-boosted and has the full yuty buff as well. I'd do imprint, but it varies depending on what percentage you got and it doesn't sound like that's an imprinted bronto anyways. Mate boost provides 33% damage resistance(or 0.66 repeating) according to the wiki and yuty buff is 20% damage resistance(or 0.80).

## 169.40.31250.66\*0.80=27.951 damage per bullet. So 50,000 divided by 27.951 is 1,788.85. So it'd take 1,789 bullets to kill the same bronto if you have it mate-boosted and yuty-buffed.

## (turrets shoot ~2bullets/sec)

## Turtles ? shell / 5 : normalDmg

## Saddles = 100 / (100 + 4 \* armour)

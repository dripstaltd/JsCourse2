My JavaScript course work and additional coding challenges

## How to use JavaScript today

Use Babel to transpile and polyfill you code, converting back to ES5 (ECMA Script 2015) to ensure browser compatibility for all users

### Releases - Annual Realeases from ES5

#### ES5

- Fully supported in all browsers (down to IE 9 from 2011)
- Ready and safe to use, target for transpiling

#### ES6+/ES2015 to ES2021

- Well supported in all modern browsers
- Not supported in older browsers
- Can use most features in production with transpiling and polyfilling

#### ESNEXT - Future

- Future versions of the language (new feature proposals that reach stage 4);
- Can already use some features in production with transpiling and polyfilling
